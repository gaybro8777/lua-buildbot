# A build bot for popular Lua projects

Lots of [Lua](http://lua.org/) projects (including Lua itself and [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/)) only release source code archives and expect users to build the project. On UNIX this is not really a problem but on Windows this can pose a significant hurdle for potential users. My Lua build bot is an attempt to solve this problem. While developing this build bot I took the following points into consideration:

 * I've had bad experiences with cross compilation so I prefer to build Windows binaries on Windows
 * I don't actually have any Windows machines and don't feel like setting one up just for this build bot
 * I want to be able to run the build bot from a cron job so it can automatically build all projects once a week

## Downloads

The following packages have been built by the Lua build bot:

 * [Lua 5.1.4](http://peterodding.com/code/lua/buildbot/downloads/lua-5.1.4.zip) (135K)
 * [LuaJIT 1.1.7](http://peterodding.com/code/lua/buildbot/downloads/LuaJIT-1.1.7.zip) (113K)
 * [LuaJIT 2.0.0-beta8](http://peterodding.com/code/lua/buildbot/downloads/LuaJIT-2.0.0-beta8.zip) (194K)

## How it works

Right now the build bot is meant to be run on my machine because it works in a very specific way, however I'm planning to make it more generally useful (and with a bit of persistence it should already be possible for other folks to get it running). At the moment I run the build bot as follows:

 * I start the build bot script from a terminal on my [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com/) installation
 * The build bot starts a headless virtual machine running Windows using [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/)
    * The virtual machine has been specifically setup for the build bot (see below)
    * When the virtual machine boots it automatically launches the build bot
 * When the build bot is executed on Windows it performs the following steps for each project:
    * Find latest available release from homepage
    * Download archive (if not already downloaded)
    * Unpack and build project
    * Copy files to be released (binaries & headers)
 * When the build bot was executed automatically on Windows, it will shut the virtual machine down

As I mentioned above the plan is to run the build bot from a cron job on a server, this is still a work in progress.

## Status

The following has not yet been implemented:

 * Deploy the virtual machine to one of my servers and run the build bot from a daily cron job?
 * Package and upload the files to be released to my homepage?

## Dependencies

In order to run the build bot on Windows I installed the following software in the virtual machine:

 * Windows XP SP3
 * The latest [Windows Platform SDK](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8279) (7.1)
 * [Lua For Windows](http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/) (v5.1.4-45)
 * My [Lua/APR binding](http://peterodding.com/code/lua/apr) (0.20)
 * `unzip.exe`, `gunzip.exe` and `tar.exe` from [UnxUtils](http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/)

### Disclaimers

 * This license only applies to the build bot itself -- I don't have any affiliation with the projects supported by the build bot, I'm just a happy user
 * Should the original authors have objections against this build bot, let me know and I will remove support for the project in question
 * I don't give any guarantees as to the published binaries. They're generated in a dedicated machine so it's very unlikely that a virus could sneak in, but you never know until you've [scanned the binaries yourself](http://www.virustotal.com/)...
